## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project locally for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (version 14 or later recommended)  
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)  
- [Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli)

### Firebase Configuration

1. **Create a new Firebase project** in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).

2. In your project, go to **Project settings** > **General**.

3. Under "Your apps", create a new **Web app**.

4. Copy the `firebaseConfig` object provided.

5. Create a new file named `.env.local` in the root of the SkinSight AI project.

6. Add the configuration values to your `.env.local` file, prefixing each key with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN="YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN"
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET="YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET"
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID"
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID="YOUR_APP_ID"
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID="YOUR_MEASUREMENT_ID"
```
7. **Enable Firestore Database:**  
   - Go to **Firestore Database** and click **Create database**.  
   - Start in **production mode** (default security rules deny all access).  
   - Firestore rules can be deployed later using:

```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore
```
### Installation & Running

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <repository-name>
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Run the development server:**
     ```bash
      npm run dev
      ```
      The application will start locally, usually at http://localhost:3000

## Deployment to Firebase App Hosting

This application is configured for easy deployment to **Firebase App Hosting**. Follow these steps to deploy your application.

### 1. Install and Log in to Firebase CLI
If you haven't already, install the Firebase Command Line Interface and log in.

```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
firebase login
```
### 2. Initialize Firebase in Your Project
If you haven't yet connected your local project to Firebase, run the `init` command.

```bash
firebase init
```
-Select Firestore and Hosting.
-Choose "Use an existing project" and select your Firebase project.
-Accept default Firestore rules (firestore.rules).
-Set your public directory (e.g., out or build for Next.js static export).
-Skip GitHub continuous deployment if you want to deploy manually.

### 3. Deploy Your Application
After initialization and rules deployment, you can deploy the entire application with a single command:

```bash
firebase deploy
```
After deployment, the Firebase CLI will provide the live URL of your SkinSight AI application.
